Hello Hello Class of ‘23!
 
We are officially introducing the ‘23 Buddy System! Starting today, you will be randomly paired with a fellow senior weekly; the two of you must then complete one of two activities for prizes!
 
After a turbulent few years, we believe COVID-deprived us of valuable class bonding time—this is how we can catch up! You’ll have the chance to complete a short activity that should take no more than a few minutes with someone new each week.
 
The goal is to interact with more of the senior class. On Wednesdays we will send out two activity options for you and your random buddy to choose from for earning credits. There will be an easier option worth $3 and a harder option worth $5. These credits can be put towards pub food or 2023 hoodies, bucket hats, and other memorabilia. At the end of the school year, our highest earner will also win a $50 gift card to the restaurant of their choice. Stay tuned for additional prizes!
 
If you’re interested, the rules will follow. Otherwise, at the bottom there’s a form if you’d like to opt-out of this bonding bears program.
 
Rules:
1.    Reach out to your new buddy!
2.    Complete the activity!
3.    Send a pic/vid of you and your buddy completing the activity to Class2023 Instagram (@Bowdoin2023) or email to cxing@bowdoin.edu

Best,
Class Council 2023
